        The group has decided on designing a website that utilizes the Spotify's API because of interest in data analytics,
        presentation, and the application of a widely available and common API into a project. Spotify's API is a very
        functional and powerful tool which will allow us to process music for each individual user of the service.
        We will be able to demonstrate out knowledge of web programming tools while possibly contributing a useful and
        interactive tool for music listeners  <br>
